The MultiSpectral Identification Array (MIA) is an attempt to produce
usefull visible light spectrum data for a full image using a series of
known illumination sources. 

Hardware:
MIA attempts to reduce the cost and increase the spectral resolution 
of full image multispectral capture. By combining a large number of 
overlaping broad spectrum filters instead of narrow band emission 
sources, MIA can take advantage of inexpensive white light sources and
commonly available filters. 

The current hardware is a logitech C920 or similar opencv compatible 
camera, an array of 7 color LED's an arduino mega1280 to control the
LED's and a cheap  HP laptop. 

Software:
MIA is based on opencv's image capture and processing functionality.
Images are synchronised with the illumination sources via serial coms.
images are written to file once every full cycle of the lighting array
Array Camera syncronisation, and image processing are handled by 
seperate threads.
Spectrum data is output to screan via gnuplot. Later versions will
attempt to build an output image displaying only known materials based
on a database of sampled spectra.

Currently most functionality is implimented in various forms but not
integrated into the main program. 
Current work focusses on this integration.
