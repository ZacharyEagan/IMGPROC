Currently active project, unfinished.

Syncronises opencv video capture with external hardware
Allows capture of distinct lighting environments.
Current bugs:
    -opencv image buffer has size 8 must be emptied and kept up with
        current solution is hack only and slows capture by x8

Hardware requirements: 
   --opencv compatible external webcam (I used a rented Logitec c920)
   --Serial controlled lighting array 
        (mine is currently based on arduino mega1280)
        Baud rate = 115200
        Parity = even
        stop bits = 2

        commands:
            'I' => set LED's to initial value
            'N' => move to next LED

        responses:
            "X\n" => X is integer value 0-9 indicating witch LED is on
